===========

Group Project Information Systems Database 543.


 This project emulates a video rental store in which a person can not have more than 5 rents out, cannot rent another video once their balance reaches $50 and the balance needs to be updated automatically.
```
This Project was instructed to be entirely automatic and was required to have at least 3 triggers.

 A real world transactional database would run mainly off of stored procedures for fee accruals.
